Question 1

Write a function that takes two arguments. The first node from a singly linked list as the first argument and any node in the list as a second argument. The function should delete the second argument (node) from the list.

Your answer will be judged on both readability and its performance in the worst-case scenario in Big O time.

You can use any language and must define your own node class.

Question 2

Write a function that, when provided the first node of a singly linked list, will sort the list by its values from smallest to largest. Do not use any built-in language sorting methods (e.g. sort in ruby)

Your answer will be judged on both readability and its performance in the worst-case scenario in Big O time.

You can use any language and must define your own node class.
